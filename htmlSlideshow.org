I want to present material using my blog entries. It is best to do a powerpoint slide. Is it possible to turn a webpage to a powerpoint slide, without changing the internal of the html pages at all? 

My first attempt is to hide all paragraphs (marked by <p> html tag). Then every mouse click will reveal one more paragraph. This is made possible with a chrome extension I made today,

To try it, follow "Load the extension" section on [[https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked][this page]].
